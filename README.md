Finished Spring 2017

A 2 player, PvP turn-based game able to be used on a wireless network.
Inspired by Fire Emblem, though this game is against another player instead of against the computer.

Uses the Gridworld framework, with new interfaces and classes replacing the original "Actor" and "Bug" system.
Also implements the a messaging system between computers that uses a self made encoding protocol to transmit coordinate and character data.
